  <h1><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/im_aprilt/full/597YS0MlF">FINAL PROJECT</a></h1>
<br>
<h2>before you begin, I would like to tell you something.<br></h2>
<p>
At first I want to do something related to fast fashion,<br>a simulation predicts the relationship between users shopping preference and carbon footprints.<br>
But I couldn't find the accurate data, <br> so I decided to slightly change a topic ! <br>
 I ask myself ”why would people keep buying clothes”, <br> it reminds me a friend in college who just told me her problem years ago <br>

Also , I ‘m inspired by the class material week 4, <br>
there a website that has lots of buttons, and your decision will lead to different story!<br></p>
<h2>which lead to my project</h2>
<br>
<p>I want to tell a story about a girl suffering from lack of confidence.<br>
She thought confidence comes from her appearance, so she keep buying clothes.<br>
In this stimulation, you could take a look into her heart,<br> and try to understand what she is thinking about <br></p>
<h2><br>
Once the background color goes deeper, <br>you are going further into her mind</h2>

<h1>Proposal </h1>
<br>
<br>

  <h2>subject related: fast fashion, ecosystem</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>Reason why I want to do this:</h3>
  <p>
  Last summer I was an intern in the group of CSR <br>(Corporate Social Responsibility), which gave in an inspiration of the relationship of clothes and ecology.
  <br>

<br>
<br>
  The fashion industry has a disastrous impact on the environment. <br>In fact, it is the second largest polluter in the world, just after the oil industry. <br>And the environmental damage is increasing as the industry grows.
<br>
<br>
In most of the countries in which garments are produced, <br>untreated toxic wastewaters from textiles factories are dumped directly into the rivers.<br> Wastewater contains toxic substances such as lead, mercury, <br>and arsenic, among others.<br> These are extremely harmful for the aquatic life and the health of the millions people living by those rivers banks. <br>The contamination also reaches the sea and eventually spreads around the globe. <br>Another major source of water contamination is the use of fertilizers for cotton production,<br> which heavily pollute runoff waters and evaporation waters.
<br>
<br>
Fashion brand such as H&M, Zara, Uniqlo produces new clothing line <br> every two or three weeks to keep up with the trend at an affordable price.<br> Fast fashion items are worn less than five times on average. <br>After the new clothing new is published, <br>consumers are eager to purchase new products. <br>However, under the cheap price what is the true cost of fast fashion?</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>what I want to do with the project?</h2>
<p>
first: asking what clothes you usually bought/ wear
<br>
second: calculate the Carbon Footprint
<br>
third: if everyone makes the same decision with you. How much longer can Earth support life?
<br>

<h1> Prototype 0.5</h1>
<br>
<p><img src="finalPrototype.jpeg" alt="Final Prototype"> <br>
I'm thinking about placing buttons for users to interact with them. <br>
first of all, I would like to ask what kinds of clothes does user usually buy (for example cotton tshirt? jeans? ) <br>
and how often do they buy per season. Then the calculator counts the CO2 emission, and how does the Earth change based on your choice. <br>
Problems I encounter: how to present this visually by coding.

<h1><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/im_aprilt/full/CRvyi1j1E">Prototype I</a></h1>
<p>
Problems I encounter: data are messy.<br>
Solution: change the topic into story telling!<br>
I changed the subject into telling a story about why a girl is obssessed with fast fashion
<br>
story could be polished</p>
<br>
<h3>what I did in Prototype </h3> 
<br>
<p>
setting the story outline, setting the levels(pages?) of the story
<br>

<br><br><br>

<br><br><br>
<h1><a href="https://editor.p5js.org/im_aprilt/full/JYyl56Pfo">Prototype II</a></h1>
<p>
Problems I encounter: not enough time, story structure(conversation) undecided.<br>
<h3>what I did in Prototype </h3> 
<br>
<p>
  First page's introduction<br>
  background color changed with different phases<br>
  interactive conversation (content still under structure)<br>

  <br>
  I might adjust the numbers of level in the heart based on time constraint <br>
  and add souund in the final project<br>
